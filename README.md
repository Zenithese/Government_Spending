# Government_Spending

## Background and Overview

The proverbial political climate is often weathered with debate, misinformation, and confusion about government spending.
This project aims to empower citizens, denizens, or otherwise with a visually intuitive resourse to overcome spending rhetoric and propaganda.

Inspired by 16segments (https://github.com/mrkvncnt/16Segments)

The app will consist of a single screen with a list of primary data on left with refinement controls, 
and a corresponding data visualization on the right. 
Addtionally, the upper right will have icons linking to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile.
